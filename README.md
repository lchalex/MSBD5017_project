## De-Github

### Installing dependencies
We are using Python 3.8 for development.

Install required packages by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### FileStorage
At the moment we are using HKUST provided endpoint to upload file and download file. 

In the future, we might deploy a smart contract ourselves as a decentralized filestorage.
